## Can I use it for my game project?
Certainly! You are free to utilize the framework for any purpose you desire, including your personal projects. The only restriction is that you are not permitted to redistribute the framework itself.



# Side Notes
Any help in the source code is highly appreciated.  
Half of the game art is done by me and the rest is from Open Game Art. If you own anything from this project, please let me know by directly contacting me.
