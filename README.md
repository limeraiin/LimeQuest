# What is LimeQuest?
LimeQuest is an open-source turn-based RPG framework written in c# with Unity3D. See the documentation for more details.

## Can I use it for my game project?
Of course! You can use it for whatever you want. The only thing that is not permitted is distributing the framework itself.

# Side Notes
1- Any help in the source code is highly appreciated.
2- Half of the game art is done by me and the rest is from Open Game Art. If you own anything from this project, please let me know by directly contacting me.
